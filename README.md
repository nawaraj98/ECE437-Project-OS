ECE437 Computer Operating Systems, Fall 2023
This project focuses on designing a thread coordination system for managing the interaction between a waiting line, explorer cars, and an arriving module. 
The objective is to efficiently handle the arrival of explorer cars, their readiness for exploration, and their interaction with the arrival module for seamless progression. 
The system employs synchronization primitives such as semaphores to ensure mutual exclusion and proper coordination between threads, thus facilitating safe and efficient management of the exploration process.
